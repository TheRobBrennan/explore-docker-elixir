# Welcome

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for exploring Elixir using Docker.

## Getting started

The easiest way to use this repo is to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and configured on your development machine.

### Local development environment

Before we Dockerize our application, let's take a look at what we would need to do if we wanted to install Elixir on our machine.

#### Install Elixir

For instructions on installing [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), please refer to the guide available at [https://elixir-lang.org/install.html](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

##### macOS

To install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install elixir

# If Elixir has already been installed, you may be instructed to upgrade to the latest version
$ brew upgrade elixir
```
