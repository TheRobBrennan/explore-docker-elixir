# Welcome

This example is meant to serve as a starting point for exploring [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - based off the original blog post [Running Elixir in Docker Containers](https://www.poeticoding.com/running-elixir-in-docker-containers/)

## Getting started

The easiest way to use this repo is to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and configured on your development machine.
